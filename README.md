# 3D Space Lander

This project is a recreation of a 3D lander style game. Where the player has to gently land a spacecraft onto 1 of 3 landing spots, given 2 minutes of fuel. The spacecraft's movement was implemented using physics (includes thrust, gravity, turbulence), and divides the terrain into an octree for ray collision detection. The game was developed using C++ and OpenFrameWorks.
